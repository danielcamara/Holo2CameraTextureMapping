# Holo2CameraTextureMapping
Attempt to port the code existing over https://github.com/tarukosu/HoloCameraTextureMapping that works for
hololens 1 to hololens 2

The efforts concentrated on remove all the compiling errors, but unfortunately, 
it is not enough. The code does not work, and I don't know why. 
This is here in the hope that someone else, with better skills on programming 
for hololens/unity/c# etc... can take it and see what is going on and why it is 
not working!
